# TicTacToe

Use the driver file to run the program. 

This is something I made just so that I could see how reinforcement learning works. The user can play against a fresh agent who starts out by simply playing the first legal move that they can make. However the user can also train the agent by making the agent play against itself (or other algorithms). After thousands of trials, the agent learns to play intelligently.
